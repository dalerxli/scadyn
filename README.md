# Scattering Dynamics

`scadyn` is a code for scattering dynamics calculations, which utilizes a volume integral equation solution for the T-matrices of non-spherical scatterers. A more complete description can be found in [Herranen et. al.](https://tuhat.helsinki.fi/portal/services/downloadRegister/90932227/RS2017.pdf) ([DOI:10.1002/2017RS006333](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017RS006333)) and references therein. 

## Installation
**Linux/OSX**
Run `install` if you dare. The installation tries to clone external libraries, which are available on request from their author. If the libraries are found, simply invoking `make` will do. An example run with minimal input can also be found from the installation script.
