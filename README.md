# Scattering Dynamics

`scadyn` is a code for scattering dynamics calculations, which utilizes a volume integral equation solution for the T-matrices of non-spherical scatterers. The main motivations for the development of this code are the study of
* grain alignment dynamics in interstellar environments,
* optical tweezers and traps.

A more complete description of the algorithm for scattering dynamics can be found in [Herranen et. al.](https://tuhat.helsinki.fi/portal/services/downloadRegister/90932227/RS2017.pdf) ([DOI:10.1002/2017RS006333](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017RS006333)) and references therein. 

## Installation
**Linux/OSX**
Run `install` if you dare. The installation is dependent on the LAPACK, BLAS, HDF5, and FFTW libraries. If the libraries are found, simply invoking `make` will do. An example run with minimal input can also be found from the installation script.

**Windows**
Library locations and compiler probably need changing. Never tried, so good luck!

## Run
Easiest way is to run `install`. The basic command is:
```
./scadyn --mesh shape.h5 -T T.h5 --paramsfile params.in
```
The geometry meshes are to be `tetgen`-compatible.
